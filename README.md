Infinite Mario in HTML5 JavaScript as custom Web control

To use the custom web control in WinCC, the hierarchy of folders and files must be
compressed. For WinCC it is necessary that this data is available in ZIP format. The name of
the ZIP file must match the GUID, for this example, "{8F2D1D74-4B07-4F7A-8800-1A75071F21B4}.zip".
